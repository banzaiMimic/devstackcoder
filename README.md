testing electron out, html5 based programming typer game<br />
<b>note : this was to test electron deployment with pure javasript and html5 canvas without a framework, built relatively quickly to get a base out. The idea is to create a WPM tester but instead of dictionary words it will test Java / Javascript / ect. Current only sends out 2 blocks of text and that's it. Nothing pretty. But electron definitely very cool.</b>
